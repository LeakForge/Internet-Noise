# Internet-Noise
Sends fake domains and websites to prevent profiling from your ISP.

## Why do i need to do this?

On March 28th, 2017 [congress passed a law](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h202) that makes it legal for your Internet Service Providers (ISP) to track and sell your personal activity online. This means that things you search for, buy, read, and say can be collected by corporations and used against you.


**NOTE**: Advertisers don't give you what you want. They manipulate you into wanting what they have.
